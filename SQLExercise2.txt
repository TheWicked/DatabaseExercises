- Find the names of all reviewers who rated Gone with the Wind.

select distinct name
from Reviewer join Rating using(rID)
where rID in (
select rID
from Rating join Movie using(mID)
where title = "Gone with the Wind")

====================================================================
- For any rating where the reviewer is the same as the director of the movie, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars.

select distinct name, title, stars
from Rating join Reviewer using(rID) join Movie using(mID)
where name = director

====================================================================
- Return all reviewer names and movie names together in a single list, alphabetized. (Sorting by the first name of the reviewer and first word in the title is fine; no need for special processing on last names or removing "The".)

select name
from Reviewer
union
select title
from Movie
order by name, title

====================================================================
- Find the titles of all movies not reviewed by Chris Jackson.

select title
from Movie
where mID not in (select mID
from Rating
where rID in (select rID
from Reviewer
where name = "Chris Jackson") )

====================================================================
- For all pairs of reviewers such that both reviewers gave a rating to the same movie, return the names of both reviewers. Eliminate duplicates, don't pair reviewers with themselves, and include each pair only once. For each pair, return the names in the pair in alphabetical order.

select nameFirst, nameSecond
from (select distinct nameFirst, nameSecond
from (select R1.rID as rIDFirst, R2.rID as rIDSecond
from Rating R1 join Rating R2 using(mID)
where R1.mID = R2.mID and R1.rID <> R2.rID)
join
(select rID as rIDFirst, name as nameFirst
from Reviewer) using(rIDFirst)
join
(select rID as rIDSecond, name as nameSecond
from Reviewer) using(rIDSecond)
order by nameFirst)
where nameFirst < nameSecond

====================================================================
- For each rating that is the lowest (fewest stars) currently in the database, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars.

select name, title, stars
from (select rID, mID, stars
from Rating R1
where not exists (select * from Rating R2 where R1.stars > R2.stars) ) join Reviewer using(rID) join Movie using(mID)

====================================================================
- List movie titles and average ratings, from highest-rated to lowest-rated. If two or more movies have the same average rating, list them in alphabetical order.

select title, avgRating
from (select mID, avg(stars) as avgRating
from Rating
group by mID) join Movie using(mID)
order by avgRating desc, title

====================================================================
- Find the names of all reviewers who have contributed three or more ratings. (As an extra challenge, try writing the query without HAVING or without COUNT.) 

select name
from Rating join Reviewer using(rID)
group by rID
having count(*) >= 3

select distinct name
from (select rID
from Rating R1
where 3 <= (select count(*) from Rating R2 where R1.rID = R2.rID) ) join Reviewer using(rID)

====================================================================
- Some directors directed more than one movie. For all such directors, return the titles of all movies directed by them, along with the director name. Sort by director name, then movie title. (As an extra challenge, try writing the query both with and without COUNT.) 

select title, director
from Movie
where director in (select director
from Movie
group by director
having count(*) >= 2)
order by director, title

select M1.title, M1.director
from Movie M1, Movie M2
where M1.director = M2.director and M1.mID <> M2.mID
order by M1.director, M1.title

====================================================================
- Find the movie(s) with the highest average rating. Return the movie title(s) and average rating. (Hint: This query is more difficult to write in SQLite than other systems; you might think of it as finding the highest average rating and then choosing the movie(s) with that average rating.)

select title, avgRating
from (select mID, avg(stars) as avgRating
from Rating
group by mID) join Movie using(mID)
where not exists (select * from (select avg(stars) as avgTest from Rating group by mID) where avgRating < avgTest)

====================================================================
- Find the movie(s) with the lowest average rating. Return the movie title(s) and average rating. (Hint: This query may be more difficult to write in SQLite than other systems; you might think of it as finding the highest average rating and then choosing the movie(s) with that average rating.) 

select title, avgRating
from (select mID, avg(stars) as avgRating
from Rating
group by mID) join Movie using(mID)
where not exists (select * from (select avg(stars) as avgTest from Rating group by mID) where avgRating > avgTest)

====================================================================
- For each director, return the director's name together with the title(s) of the movie(s) they directed that received the highest rating among all of their movies, and the value of that rating. Ignore movies whose director is NULL.

select distinct director, title, stars
from (select *
from Rating join Movie using(mID) ) BestMovies
where not exists (select * from Rating join Movie using(mID) where BestMovies.director = director and BestMovies.stars < stars) and not director isnull
